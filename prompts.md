Okay, let's craft a detailed plan for building a simple e-commerce management system using an AI-Native approach with Python, TDD, and the Cursor IDE. This plan emphasizes leveraging AI throughout the development lifecycle, not just as a feature within the application.

**Project Goal:** To create a foundational backend system for managing core e-commerce operations (products, inventory, orders) for a small business, developed efficiently and robustly using AI-assisted tools and Test-Driven Development.

**Core Philosophy:**

1.  **AI-Native Development:** Utilize AI (primarily through Cursor) at every stage: requirements refinement, test generation, code implementation, debugging, refactoring, documentation, and potentially for specific application features.
2.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests *before* writing implementation code (Red-Green-Refactor cycle). This ensures code correctness, facilitates refactoring, and serves as living documentation.
3.  **Simplicity First (MVP):** Focus on the absolute essential features first, building a solid foundation before adding complexity.
4.  **Python Stack:** Leverage the mature Python ecosystem for web development, data handling, and AI integration.
5.  **Cursor IDE:** Actively use Cursor's AI features to accelerate development, improve code quality, and learn faster.

**I. Core Requirements Definition**

Before coding, let's define the essential functionalities. We'll use Cursor's chat/prompting capabilities to refine these and explore potential edge cases *before* writing tests.

1.  **Product Management:**
    * Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) products.
    * Product attributes: SKU (unique identifier), Name, Description, Price, Category (optional, simple string initially), Active/Inactive status.
    * Ability to upload/associate one primary image per product.
    * *AI Potential:* Use Cursor/AI to generate draft product descriptions based on name/category/keywords.
2.  **Inventory Management:**
    * Track stock quantity for each product (or product variant, if needed later).
    * Automatically decrement stock when an order is confirmed/shipped.
    * Automatically increment stock if an order is cancelled/returned (handle manually initially for simplicity).
    * View current stock levels.
    * *AI Potential:* Basic low-stock alerts (threshold-based). Future: AI-driven demand forecasting.
3.  **Order Management:**
    * Record incoming orders (can be entered manually initially or via a simple API endpoint).
    * Order attributes: Order ID (unique), Customer Name, Customer Email, Shipping Address, Order Date, Order Status (e.g., Pending, Processing, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled), List of items (Product SKU, Quantity, Price at time of order), Total Amount.
    * Ability to view orders and filter/search by status or customer email.
    * Ability to update order status.
4.  **User Authentication & Authorization (Management Interface):**
    * Secure login for system administrators/staff.
    * Basic role distinction (e.g., Admin - full access, Staff - maybe view only or limited updates). (Start with Admin only for MVP).
5.  **API Endpoints (Optional but Recommended):**
    * Provide basic RESTful APIs for the CRUD operations above. This allows future integration with a separate storefront or other tools.

---

**II. Technology Stack Selection**

* **Language:** Python (latest stable version, e.g., 3.11+)
* **Web Framework:** Choose one:
    * **Flask:** Micro-framework, flexible, good for APIs and smaller projects. Easier learning curve initially.
    * **Django:** Batteries-included framework, built-in ORM, admin interface, more structure. Might be slightly faster for features like auth and the admin panel.
    * *Recommendation for Simplicity:* **Flask** initially, as it enforces less structure, allowing more focus on TDD flow, but Django's built-in admin could be a quick win for the *management* aspect. Let's proceed assuming Flask for flexibility, but acknowledge Django's advantages.
* **Database:**
    * **SQLite:** Simple, file-based, great for development and very small deployments.
    * **PostgreSQL:** Robust, feature-rich, better for production and scalability.
    * *Recommendation:* Start with **SQLite** for ease of setup during development, but plan/structure code (using an ORM) to easily switch to **PostgreSQL** for deployment.
* **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):**
    * **SQLAlchemy:** Powerful and flexible, works well with Flask.
    * *Recommendation:* **SQLAlchemy** (or Django ORM if using Django).
* **Testing Framework:**
    * **pytest:** De facto standard, expressive, great plugin ecosystem.
    * *Recommendation:* **pytest** along with plugins like `pytest-flask`, `pytest-cov` (for coverage).
* **API Documentation (if building APIs):**
    * **Swagger/OpenAPI:** Standard for documenting REST APIs. Libraries like `Flask-RESTx` or `Flask-Swagger-UI` can help.
* **IDE:** Cursor
* **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
* **Containerization (Optional but Recommended):** Docker (for consistent development and deployment environments).

---

**III. Phased Development Plan (TDD & AI-Native Focus)**

**Phase 0: Setup & Foundation (The "Scaffolding")**

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    * Install Python, Pip, Git.
    * Set up a virtual environment (`venv` or `conda`).
    * Install Cursor IDE.
    * Initialize Git repository.
    * Create basic project structure (`app/`, `tests/`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`).
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* Ask Cursor to generate a standard Python project structure for a Flask/SQLAlchemy application. Ask for a basic `.gitignore` file for Python.
2.  **Install Core Dependencies:** Add Flask, SQLAlchemy, pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-flask (and database driver if needed, e.g., `psycopg2-binary` for PostgreSQL later) to `requirements.txt` and install.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* Paste your initial requirements; ask Cursor to generate the `requirements.txt` file with common versions.
3.  **Basic Flask App:** Create a minimal Flask app (`app/__init__.py`, `app/routes.py`) with a simple health check route (`/ping` returning `pong`).
4.  **Setup Testing:** Configure `pytest`. Write the *first test* for the health check route (`tests/test_routes.py`).
    * **TDD Cycle:**
        * **Red:** Write `test_ping()` asserting a 200 status and "pong" response. Run `pytest` - it should fail.
        * **Green:** Implement the `/ping` route in `app/routes.py`. Run `pytest` - it should pass.
        * **Refactor:** Code is minimal, little to refactor yet.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* Ask Cursor to generate a basic `pytest.ini` configuration. Ask for a pytest fixture to set up the Flask test client. Ask to generate the initial `test_ping()` test structure based on the requirement.
5.  **Database Configuration:** Configure SQLAlchemy to connect to the SQLite DB. Set up basic Flask-SQLAlchemy integration.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Generate Flask-SQLAlchemy configuration boilerplate for connecting to an SQLite database located at `instance/myapp.db`."
6.  **CI/CD Pipeline (Basic):** Set up a simple GitHub Action (or GitLab CI) workflow that runs `pytest` on every push/pull request.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Generate a basic GitHub Actions workflow YAML file that checks out the code, sets up Python, installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and runs `pytest`."
7.  **Docker Setup (Optional):** Create a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for building and running the application and potentially the database in containers.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Generate a `Dockerfile` for a Flask application using Gunicorn." "Generate a `docker-compose.yml` to run the Flask app service and a PostgreSQL service."

**Phase 1: User Authentication & Authorization (Admin Only MVP)**

1.  **Model:** Define a simple `User` model (e.g., `id`, `username`, `password_hash`, `role='admin'`). Use SQLAlchemy.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Define a SQLAlchemy model named `User` with fields: id (primary key, integer), username (unique string), password_hash (string), role (string, default 'admin'). Include a method to hash passwords using Werkzeug and check passwords."
2.  **TDD for Model:** Write tests for the User model (`tests/test_models.py`). Test creation, password hashing, password checking.
    * **Red:** Write `test_user_creation`, `test_password_hashing`, `test_password_verification`. Fail.
    * **Green:** Implement the model and methods. Pass.
    * **Refactor:** Improve clarity, add docstrings. Use Cursor to explain the hashing logic or suggest improvements.
3.  **Database Migrations:** Introduce Alembic (or Flask-Migrate) for managing database schema changes. Create the initial migration for the User table.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Show me how to set up Flask-Migrate with my Flask-SQLAlchemy app."
4.  **TDD for Auth Routes:** Plan basic routes (`/login`, `/logout`, maybe a protected `/admin/dashboard` placeholder). Use Flask-Login or JWT for session management.
    * **Red:** Write tests (`tests/test_auth.py`) for:
        * `test_login_success` (valid credentials, session set)
        * `test_login_failure` (invalid credentials)
        * `test_logout` (session cleared)
        * `test_access_protected_route_unauthenticated` (redirects to login)
        * `test_access_protected_route_authenticated` (succeeds)
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Generate pytest tests for a Flask login route using Flask-Login. Include tests for success, failure (wrong password, user not found), and correct redirection."
    * **Green:** Implement the login/logout routes, session handling, and `@login_required` decorator logic. Use Cursor to generate boilerplate Flask route code, handle form data, interact with the User model, and integrate Flask-Login.
    * **Refactor:** Ensure security best practices (e.g., CSRF protection if using session cookies). Ask Cursor: "Review this Flask login code for potential security vulnerabilities."

**Phase 2: Product Management**

1.  **Model:** Define `Product` model (SKU, Name, Description, Price, Category, Image URL placeholder, Stock Quantity, Is Active). Link stock here for simplicity initially.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Define a SQLAlchemy model `Product` with fields..." (specify types, constraints like unique SKU).
2.  **TDD for Model:** Write tests for `Product` model creation, validations (e.g., price > 0, unique SKU).
3.  **Database Migration:** Create migration for the Product table.
4.  **TDD for CRUD API/Routes:** Define routes/API endpoints (e.g., `POST /api/products`, `GET /api/products`, `GET /api/products/<sku>`, `PUT /api/products/<sku>`, `DELETE /api/products/<sku>`). Protect these routes (require login).
    * **Red:** Write tests (`tests/test_products.py`) for each endpoint: success cases, error cases (invalid data, SKU not found, unauthorized access).
        * Example: `test_create_product_success`, `test_create_product_missing_name`, `test_get_product_found`, `test_get_product_not_found`, `test_update_product_success`, `test_delete_product_unauthorized`.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Generate pytest tests for a Flask REST API endpoint `POST /api/products` which creates a product. Include tests for valid data (201 Created), invalid data (400 Bad Request), and unauthorized access (401 Unauthorized)."
    * **Green:** Implement the Flask routes/views. Handle JSON request data, validate input, interact with the `Product` model using SQLAlchemy sessions, handle database commits/rollbacks, return appropriate JSON responses and status codes.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Generate a Flask route for `POST /api/products`. It should accept JSON data, validate it against the Product model requirements, create a new Product using SQLAlchemy, and return the created product data with a 201 status code. Ensure it requires login."
    * **Refactor:** Organize code (e.g., use Flask Blueprints). Improve error handling. Add input validation logic (perhaps using a library like Marshmallow or Pydantic). Ask Cursor: "Refactor this Flask route to use a Pydantic model for input validation."
5.  **AI Feature (Optional):** Add a button/function in the management interface (or an API call) that takes product name/category and uses an LLM (via API call like OpenAI's) to generate a draft description. Use Cursor to help write the API call logic and handle the response. Write tests for this helper function.

**Phase 3: Inventory Management (Integrated with Product)**

1.  **Logic:** Inventory is currently a field (`stock_quantity`) on the `Product` model. The core logic involves updating this field accurately.
2.  **TDD for Inventory Updates:** Focus on testing the *effects* of actions on stock. Since orders don't exist yet, write tests for *potential* inventory adjustment functions/logic (which will be used later by orders).
    * **Red:** Write tests (`tests/test_inventory.py` or within `test_products.py` if tightly coupled):
        * `test_decrement_stock_success`
        * `test_decrement_stock_insufficient_stock` (should fail or raise error)
        * `test_increment_stock_success`
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Generate pytest tests for a function `adjust_stock(product_sku, quantity_change)` that updates the `stock_quantity` of a Product in the database. Test positive changes, negative changes, and attempting to go below zero stock."
    * **Green:** Implement the `adjust_stock` function or methods within the Product service/repository layer. Ensure atomic updates if necessary (though less critical with SQLite initially). Use Cursor to help write the database update logic safely.
    * **Refactor:** Ensure the stock adjustment logic is robust and reusable.

**Phase 4: Order Management**

1.  **Models:** Define `Order` (Order ID, Customer details, Date, Status, Total Amount) and `OrderItem` (links Order to Product, stores Quantity and Price *at the time of order*). Establish relationships (Order has many OrderItems, OrderItem links to one Product).
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Define SQLAlchemy models `Order` and `OrderItem` with specified fields and a one-to-many relationship between them. `OrderItem` should also have a many-to-one relationship with `Product`."
2.  **Database Migrations:** Create migrations for Order and OrderItem tables.
3.  **TDD for Order Creation Logic:** This is crucial. Test the service function/logic that creates an order.
    * **Red:** Write tests (`tests/test_orders.py`) covering:
        * `test_create_order_success` (stock decreases, order/items created correctly, total calculated)
        * `test_create_order_insufficient_stock` (order fails, stock unchanged)
        * `test_create_order_invalid_product_sku`
        * `test_calculate_order_total` (separate unit test if logic is complex)
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Generate pytest tests for an `create_order(customer_data, items_list)` service function. It should: create Order/OrderItem records, calculate the total based on current product prices, *decrement stock* for each item, and fail if any item has insufficient stock. Ensure database changes are rolled back on failure."
    * **Green:** Implement the order creation service logic. This involves database transactions: fetch products, check stock, create Order record, create OrderItem records, decrement stock for each product, commit. Use Cursor to help structure the transaction logic and error handling.
    * **Refactor:** Encapsulate order creation logic cleanly within a service class or functions. Ask Cursor: "Review this order creation logic for potential race conditions or transaction issues."
4.  **TDD for Order Viewing/Status Updates:** Add API endpoints/routes (e.g., `GET /api/orders`, `GET /api/orders/<id>`, `PUT /api/orders/<id>/status`).
    * **Red:** Write tests for retrieving orders, filtering, updating status (e.g., `test_update_order_status_valid`, `test_update_order_status_invalid_transition`).
    * **Green:** Implement the routes, ensuring appropriate authorization.
    * **Refactor:** Improve querying efficiency if needed.

**Phase 5: Basic Management Interface & Refinement**

1.  **Interface Choice:** Decide:
    * **Simple HTML Templates:** Use Flask's template engine (Jinja2) to render basic HTML pages for viewing/managing products and orders. Less modern but potentially faster for a simple backend tool.
    * **API + Simple Frontend:** Keep the Flask app as a pure API and build a separate, minimal frontend using HTML/CSS/JavaScript (maybe a simple framework like Alpine.js or HTMX) that consumes the API. More separation, potentially more work initially.
    * **Use Django Admin:** If you switched to Django, leverage its built-in admin interface for rapid CRUD views.
    * *Recommendation:* If using Flask, start with simple Jinja2 templates for speed.
2.  **Implement Views:** Create Flask routes that render templates displaying lists of products/orders and forms for editing/creating. Use the existing service logic and models.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Generate a Flask route `/admin/products` that queries all products using SQLAlchemy and renders a Jinja2 template `products.html`, passing the products list." "Generate a basic Jinja2 template `products.html` to display a list of products in an HTML table with Edit/Delete links."
3.  **TDD (for Frontend?):** TDD is harder for traditional frontend rendering. Focus TDD on the *backend routes* that serve the data to the templates. You can write integration tests that check if the correct template is rendered and potentially if key data appears in the HTML response (using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` in tests), but keep it high-level.
4.  **Refinement:** Review the usability. Add basic searching/filtering to lists. Improve error messages.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* Ask for code improvements, alternative ways to structure template logic, or ways to make forms easier to handle in Flask.

**Phase 6: Deployment & Monitoring**

1.  **Choose Deployment Platform:** Heroku, AWS (EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda), Google Cloud (App Engine, Cloud Run), DigitalOcean App Platform, etc.
2.  **Prepare for Production:**
    * Switch Database to PostgreSQL (update config, install driver). Run migrations.
    * Configure a production web server (Gunicorn, uWSGI) behind a reverse proxy (Nginx).
    * Set environment variables for secrets (DB password, API keys, Flask secret key).
    * Configure logging.
    * *AI Assist (Cursor):* "Generate a Gunicorn configuration file." "Show an example Nginx configuration for proxying requests to a Gunicorn Flask app."
3.  **Deploy:** Use Docker containers for easier deployment or follow platform-specific guides.
4.  **Monitoring:** Set up basic health checks, logging aggregation (e.g., Sentry, Datadog), and potentially performance monitoring.

---

**IV. AI Integration Strategy (How to be "AI-Native")**

* **Cursor as Co-Pilot:**
    * **Code Generation:** Generate boilerplate (models, routes, tests), implement functions based on comments or tests.
    * **Debugging:** Paste errors or problematic code snippets and ask for explanations or fixes.
    * **Test Generation:** Ask Cursor to generate test cases based on function signatures or requirements (especially edge cases).
    * **Refactoring:** Select code and ask for refactoring suggestions (e.g., "Extract this logic into a function," "Make this code more Pythonic," "Improve efficiency").
    * **Explanation:** Ask Cursor to explain complex code snippets, library usage, or concepts (e.g., "Explain database transactions in SQLAlchemy").
    * **Documentation:** Generate docstrings or README sections.
* **In-App AI Features (Start Simple):**
    * **Product Description Generation:** Call an external LLM API.
    * **(Future):** Demand forecasting, recommendation engines, AI-powered search within the admin panel, anomaly detection in orders.

---

**V. TDD Workflow Emphasis**

1.  **Red:** Write a small, focused test for a specific piece of functionality *that doesn't exist yet*. Run tests; see it fail. Use Cursor to help structure the test if needed.
2.  **Green:** Write the *minimum* amount of application code required to make the test pass. Use Cursor heavily here for generating implementation code based on the test's intent. Run tests; see it pass.
3.  **Refactor:** Improve the structure, readability, and efficiency of *both* the test code and the application code *while keeping the tests passing*. Use Cursor to identify areas for refactoring or suggest cleaner implementations. Commit frequently after each cycle.
4.  **Coverage:** Regularly check test coverage (`pytest --cov=app`) and aim for high coverage on core logic, but don't chase 100% obsessively if it means writing trivial tests.

---

**VI. Important Considerations**

* **Security:** Always be mindful of security (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, password hashing, authorization checks). Ask Cursor to review code specifically for security flaws.
* **Scalability:** While starting simple, using an ORM and potentially containerization provides a path to scaling later (e.g., switching to PostgreSQL, deploying more app instances).
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and logging.
* **Configuration Management:** Manage database URIs, secret keys, etc., via environment variables or config files, not hardcoded.
* **Asynchronous Tasks:** For potentially long-running tasks (like complex reports or external API calls), consider task queues (Celery, RQ) later.

---

This detailed plan provides a roadmap. Remember to be flexible, iterate, and leverage the AI capabilities of Cursor throughout the process to make development faster, more robust, and a better learning experience. Good luck!

MK: I like all your recommendations, so let's go with all that are compatible with each other. Please start with phase 0 and I'll replicate what you tell me in Cursor.
